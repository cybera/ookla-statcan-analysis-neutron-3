Based on the analysis of upload and download speeds across provinces, following insights can be drawn. Firstly, for upload speed, Nunavut stands out as the only province that experienced a significant decrease in speed from 2019Q3 to 2023Q1, dropping from 45.9k to 8.5k kbps. This suggests a potential issue or challenge specific to Nunavut's upload infrastructure.

On the other hand, for download speed, all provinces have shown improvements compared to 2019q1. However, there was a noticeable decrease between 2022Q1 and 2022Q2 for most provinces. This dip in performance could be attributed to temporary factors such as network upgrades or maintenance activities. Fortunately, the subsequent data indicates a clear upward trend, indicating that the download speeds have recovered and continued to improve.

Overall, the data suggests that provinces have made progress in terms of download speed, while the issue of lower upload speed in Nunavut needs further attention. These insights can inform decision-making processes regarding network infrastructure investments and improvement strategies to enhance both upload and download speeds across provinces, ensuring better internet experiences for residents and businesses.

Download speed/upload speed ratio is a metric that measures the ratio between the download speed and upload speed of internet connections. It is an important indicator as it reflects the relative performance and efficiency of internet connections for both downloading data from the internet and uploading data to the internet. A higher ratio indicates faster download speeds compared to upload speeds, while a lower ratio suggests relatively slower download speeds compared to upload speeds.

Analyzing the trend of the download speed/upload speed ratio over time, it is observed that, in general, the ratio tends to decrease. This can be attributed to the growing demand for faster download speeds, which often leads to a greater focus on optimizing download performance. Consequently, the upload speeds may not receive the same level of improvement, resulting in a decline in the ratio.

However, it is worth noting that in some provinces, there has been an increase in the download speed/upload speed ratio from 2019Q1 to 2023Q1. This indicates that these provinces have experienced a relatively larger improvement in download speeds compared to upload speeds. This could be a result of specific investments or upgrades targeting download performance, while upload speeds have seen comparatively lesser enhancements.

These insights suggest that while the overall trend shows a decrease in the download speed/upload speed ratio, there are provinces that have managed to improve this ratio over time. This highlights the importance of considering both download and upload speeds when evaluating internet performance, as well as the need to address the imbalance between the two for a more balanced and efficient internet experience.

British Columbia and New Brunswick consistently rank as the top two provinces in terms of download speed. This suggests that these provinces have made consistent efforts to provide faster download speeds to their residents. On the other hand, the northern provinces and territories, including Yukon, Nunavut, and the Northwest Territories, consistently have the lowest download speeds. This could be due to various factors such as geographical challenges and limited infrastructure in these regions.

In terms of upload speed, a similar pattern is observed based on the location of the provinces. Coastal provinces, such as British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia, tend to outperform central provinces in terms of upload speed. Notably, Quebec ranks first in upload speed in 2023Q1, showcasing improvements in its upload infrastructure. Conversely, Nunavut consistently ranks last in upload speed, indicating the need for further investments and enhancements in this region.

The running bar plots for both download and upload speeds reveal clear cluster patterns among provinces. This suggests that there are distinct groups of provinces that share similar internet speed characteristics. Further exploration and clustering analysis could provide valuable insights into the factors influencing these patterns and assist in identifying areas for targeted improvements.

Overall, these insights highlight the varying performance of provinces in terms of internet speeds, with coastal provinces generally demonstrating better performance and northern regions facing challenges in providing high-speed internet access. This information can guide policymakers and stakeholders in identifying areas for infrastructure development and improving internet speeds to bridge the digital divide across different provinces.

Additive time series decomposition is a method used to break down a time series into its constituent components: trend, seasonality, and randomness. By separating these elements, additive decomposition allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns and variations in the data. The trend component represents the long-term direction, the seasonality component captures recurring patterns, and the residual component accounts for the unexplained fluctuations. This decomposition technique is valuable as it enables evaluation of each component individually, gain insights into the data's behavior, and make more accurate predictions. It also aids in selecting appropriate modeling approaches that can account for specific characteristics of the time series.

**ACF (Autocorrelation Function)** and **PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)** are important tools in time series analysis, particularly for fitting **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)** models. They provide insights into the underlying autocorrelation structure of the time series data, which is essential for determining the appropriate order of the ARIMA model.

**ACF** measures the autocorrelation between a time series and its lagged (previous) values. It helps identify the presence of correlation in the time series at different lag levels. By examining the ACF plot, it is easy to identify the decay pattern of autocorrelation, which indicates the appropriate order of the Moving Average (MA) component in the ARIMA model. The significant spikes in the ACF plot at specific lags suggest the need for including MA terms in the model.

**PACF** measures the correlation between a time series and its lagged values while controlling for the influence of intervening lags. It provides information about the direct relationship between the observations at different lags, after accounting for the intermediate lags. Examining the PACF plot helps to identify the order of the Autoregressive (AR) component in the ARIMA model. The significant spikes in the PACF plot at specific lags suggest the need for including AR terms in the model.

In short, analyzing the ACF and PACF plots is essential to identify the presence of autocorrelation and determine the appropriate orders for the AR and MA components of the ARIMA model.''')

st.markdown('### 2.3. Stationarity Checks')
st.markdown('''
Stationarity is a fundamental concept in time series analysis refering to the statistical properties of a time series remaining constant over time. A stationary time series exhibits **consistent mean, variance, and autocovariance structures**, irrespective of when the observations are collected. 

This means that the statistical characteristics of the time series, such as the average value and variability, do not change with time. Stationary time series are easier to model and analyze as they allow for the application of various mathematical techniques, such as forecasting and identifying patterns or trends. Ensuring stationarity is often a prerequisite for employing time series models and accurately interpreting their results.

As shown in above parts, Alberta's Download Speed has a clear upward trend which provides clues about non-stationarity of the time series. However, it is better to check stationarity with a statistical test (**Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test**) and following hypotheses:

st.markdown('''
Differencing is a commonly used technique in time series analysis to address non-stationarity. When a time series exhibits trends, seasonality, or other forms of non-stationary behavior, differencing can help remove or reduce these effects, making the data more stationary. By taking the difference between consecutive observations, differencing eliminates the trend component and focuses on the changes or fluctuations in the data. This process helps stabilize the mean and variance of the time series, making it easier to model and analyze.

Using Alberta's Download Speed data first order differencing applied and stationarity test was repeated with differenced data using the same (mentioned) hypotheses.

Based on the absence of significant spikes in the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) after differencing the dataset, it can be concluded that the differenced data does not exhibit any apparent linear relationship or correlation with its past values. This suggests that the differenced series may not possess any significant autoregressive (AR) or moving average (MA) components.

In cases, when the ACF and PACF plots do not show significant autocorrelation patterns, it indicates that an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is not appropriate for modeling the data.

In conclusion, the analysis of upload and download speeds across provinces reveals several key insights. The data indicates an overall improvement in download speeds compared to 2019Q1, with a temporary decrease observed between 2022Q1 and 2022Q2 for most provinces. However, the subsequent data shows a recovery and continued upward trend. Nunavut stands out as the only province with a significant decrease in upload speed, suggesting a specific infrastructure challenge in that region. The download speed/upload speed ratio, which generally decreases over time, highlights the importance of considering both aspects of internet performance. British Columbia and New Brunswick consistently rank highest in download speed, while coastal provinces outperform central provinces in terms of upload speed. Further clustering analysis of provinces based on internet speeds could provide deeper insights for targeted improvements. These findings can inform decision-making processes for infrastructure investments and strategies to enhance internet speeds across provinces, aiming for a more balanced and efficient internet experience nationwide.

The analysis of Alberta's Download Speed Data, on the other hand, reveals an increasing trend and seasonality. The ADF test indicates the presence of non-stationarity in the original data, while differencing the data successfully achieves stationarity. However, the absence of significant autocorrelation patterns suggests that an ARIMA model may not be appropriate. Alternative modeling approaches should be considered to capture the underlying patterns. Overall, this analysis highlights the need for further exploration and alternative modeling techniques for the Alberta Download Speed Data.
